# Get the Check-list

Manager Scott left you a DM on slack last night, he says:

*Manager Scott* _(11:25PM)_ :"`Hey, I scheduled us months ago for our
yearly compliance audit. They’re going to be here tomorrow. I told them
we follow the CIS Server Level 1 benchmark, that’s cool right? We
definitely don’t want to fail _another_ audit.`"

Can you get this system within 90% compliance with the *CIS Server Level
1* benchmark?
